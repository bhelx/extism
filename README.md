Add a flexible, secure, and _bLaZiNg FaSt_ plug-in system to your project. Server, desktop, mobile, web, database -- you name it. Enable users to write and execute safe extensions to your software in **3 easy steps:**

### 1. Import

Import an Extism Host SDK into your code as a library dependency.

### 2. Integrate 

Identify the place(s) in your code where some arbitrary logic should run (the plug-in!), returning your code some results.

### 3. Execute

Load WebAssembly modules at any time in your app's lifetime and Extism will execute them in a secure sandbox, fully isolated from your program's memory.
